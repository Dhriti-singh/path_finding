# Path Finding Visulizer
A basic web application for finding the path(2D) from the start node to the end node. *Optimization* of the path will entirely depend on the algorithm and heuristic chosen. 

##DEMO
The working of the web application can be found at https://dhriti-singh.github.io/.

## ALGORITHMS
Thr following are the algorithms supported by the program.
 1. Depth First Search 
 2. Breath First Search #
 3. Dijkstra #
 4. Best First Search
 5. A star #
 6. Iterative Deepning Depth First Search #
 7. Iterative Deepning A star search #
 
For the algorithms with "*#*" next to them,  the shortest path is guaranteed when we search using these algorithms. Another condition to obtain the shortest path is to have an admissible heuristic. 
## BLOCKS AND WEIGHTS
Different typed of weights are provided to get the pathfinding a more real-life touch. The higher the value of the weight more the cost of walking through that node. Passing through a walkable node leads to a cost 1 per node.  
## MAZE PATTERNS
This application contains a section to get recursively drawn maze with a single path solution which creates a maze every time, along with a random distribution for weights and not walkable blocks.

##### ToDo
add relavent images of the application
